# IAM Mock

This is just a simple python dictionary meant to mock what IAM permission bindings would look like.

The script `use_case_01.py` walks through a use case, which pauses and waits for keyboard input to continue.

## Requirements

No requirements.txt necessary, this was written and run with python 3.7 using no extra packages.
